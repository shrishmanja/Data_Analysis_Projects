### Revenue by Movie Genre Analysis

#### Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to calculate the total revenue generated by each movie genre from the opensource DVDrental database and rank genres based on revenue.
The aim of this analysis is to apply the Basic SQL skills to identifythe the top performing movie genre by merging data from multiple tables in the database.

#### SQL Skills Applied
`SELECT`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `SUM`, `ORDER BY`

#### Approach Taken
1. Explore relevant tables (payment, rental, inventory, film_category, category) to identify the necessary columns for linking movie rentals, payments, and genres.
2. Using the SELECT statement, visualize the key columns across all the relevant tables to understand relationships and identify foreign/primary keys.
3. Join Tables:
Develop a SQL query to join the payment table with rental, inventory, film, and category tables to bring together data related to movie rentals and their corresponding genre.
4. Group by Genre:
Use GROUP BY to aggregate the revenue data by movie genre (category).
5. Revenue Calculation:
Use SUM(amount) to calculate the total revenue for each movie genre from the payment table.
6. Ranking by Revenue:
Order the genres by total revenue in descending order to rank them.
