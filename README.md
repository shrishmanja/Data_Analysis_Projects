# Data Analysis Projects
This repository contains multiple data analysis and machine learning projects that demonstrate my expertise in Python, SQL, R, data visualization, and modeling. Each folder represents a standalone project with its own README file, dataset, and code along with libraries essential for each project.

Feel free to explore, collaborate and share your feedback with me.
